# Movie Trailer Website

### Description
Server-side Python written to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery, a movie trailer URL, and a description of that movie. The data is served as a web page allowing visitors to view the movies and read the description.

###Demo

###Notes
Unless you're running on a server, you may need to change the location of the background image in default.css to get the whole experience ;)
